## 10.1.24. 
#### more git stuff, new most of it, markup (*markdown) is cool

## AWS EC2
##### 18.233.33.1 (use http not https for now)
##### ssh -i 260startupKey.pem ubuntu@18.233.33.1
##### interesting stufffs, certainly dope

## Route 53
### https://storyboard.ninja/ 
#### boom we did it, that was kinda rough with amazon putting a hold on me
#### we got records to route the root domain and all subdomains to my public ip address

## HTTPS, TLS, and web certificates
#### ACME is the bomb, hardly had to do anything and Caddy took care of it

## HTML
### I mean it's cool lol, don't think I'll really write that much about it
